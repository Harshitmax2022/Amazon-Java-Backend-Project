# Java-Backend-Project

We were a team of 4 from the Masai Web-15 batch. We worked on creating REST API and writing business logic for an E-commerce application. Our project performs fundamental operations of an e-commerce website, where our customer's data is validated, mapped, processed with business logic &amp; persisted in the database.
